      hash: 081d940ecd723fc1db34a235bd6085374bc68617
      body: |
        This approach aims to reduce complexity by using a triggered action
        specifically for syncing github orgs when a repo is updated/inserted.

        I've re-used the Octokit setup from the integration class, as it has
        some complicated logic for determining which app installation to use
        when making requests. In the future I would hope to install apps into
        loops and skip this step, but for now it made sense to re-use the code
        instead of duplicating it.

        Resolves https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/issues/8784

      body: |
        this change simplifies PR handling a lot and removes any JF logic
        that tries to interfere with what we get from GH.

        We also create check-runs and commits from PRs only of the head
        of the PR changed

        this removes the need for manually creating installation contracts.
        It does update automatically if a new org gets onboarded, BUT
        it needs a restart should the app get uninstalled and reinstalled
        in the same app.
